# Waterloo Housing Price Predictor
 
The overall goal of the machine learning tool is to provide students with reliable insight regarding housing prices in the Waterloo region based on various factors.

There will be 3 main modules:

1. Aquisition

This should include methods of acquiring raw data (house attributes, rent price, etc.) and any other procedures used (using ChatGPT to parse data from Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji).

2. Processing

This should include all procedures of processing the data, such as labeling, calculating distance to campus, distance to grocery stores.

3. Prediction

This is the main prediction algorithm, and should provide results of evaluation metrics.

4. Deliverables

This will include any previous or future course deliverable submissions.
