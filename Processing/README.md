dist_to_campus(list,bool)

Takes in a list of addresses and calculate the geographic distances (on roads) to campus. Set bool to True to show the plotted routes from all houses to campus, note that this would increase the computation time by considerable amount.

dist_to_POI(list,bool,option)

Takes in a list of addresses and calculate the geographic distances (on roads) to the closest point of interest. Set bool to True to show the plotted routes from all houses to each respective closest grocery store, note that this would increase the computation time by considerable amount. Set option to "grocery" or "bus" to specify the type of POI.
